Act as a Senior QA + Git verification agent inside my Replit workspace.

Goal: verify whether the changes from branch `qa-fixes/2026-01-27` are actually applied in this workspace, and whether they exist locally, remotely (GitHub), and in the running app.

Do NOT assume anything. Prove it with commands + outputs.

STEP 1) Git truth check (local)
Run and print outputs:
- git status -sb
- git branch --show-current
- git branch -vv
- git rev-parse HEAD
- git log --oneline --decorate -n 15
- git show --name-only --oneline e6d4851
- git show --name-only --oneline 303d434
- git diff --stat HEAD~2..HEAD

If I am NOT on `qa-fixes/2026-01-27`, checkout it:
- git checkout qa-fixes/2026-01-27

STEP 2) File-level verification
Open and show the exact lines changed in `QA_REPORT.md` that correspond to:
- QA-002 “fail closed on config load failure”
- QA-004 “document blocker/high status”
Use a diff view:
- git diff HEAD~2..HEAD -- QA_REPORT.md
Then confirm the entries exist in the current file content (search in file).

STEP 3) Remote verification (if remote exists)
Run and print:
- git remote -v
- git fetch --all --prune
If an origin remote exists:
- git ls-remote --heads origin | grep "qa-fixes/2026-01-27" || true
- git log --oneline qa-fixes/2026-01-27..origin/qa-fixes/2026-01-27 2>/dev/null || true
If no remote exists, clearly say: “Remote not configured, can’t confirm GitHub state.”

STEP 4) Build/runtime verification
Based on package.json, run the repo’s standard checks and show results:
- npm install (if needed)
- npm run check OR (npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test) depending on scripts
Then start the app (web or client as supported) and confirm no immediate crash.
Also scan logs for:
- unhandled promise rejections
- red screen / runtime errors

STEP 5) Final verdict (single clear summary)
Return a short verdict with:
- Current branch + HEAD commit
- Whether e6d4851 and 303d434 are present in history
- Whether QA_REPORT.md contains the intended changes
- Whether checks pass
- Whether remote branch exists (if remote configured)
- Any remaining risk or mismatch found
