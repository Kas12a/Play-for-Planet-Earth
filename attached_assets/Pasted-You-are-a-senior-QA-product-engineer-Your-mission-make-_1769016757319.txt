You are a senior QA + product engineer. Your mission: make “Play for Planet Earth (PfPE)” ready for a real-world pilot (schools/youth groups/councils). 

CONTEXT
- Product: Play for Planet Earth (PfPE) – a gamified climate-action app with quests, points/badges, leaderboards, rewards, and profiles.
- The live PWA may be accessible at: https://play4earth.co (if you have internet access).
- Current MVP is built with Expo + Supabase (assume typical React Native / Expo Router patterns unless repo shows otherwise).
- We already saw usability signals: misclick/UI confusion is high (approx. 45% in sign-up, 49% in quest start). Users like the mission concept and visual design. Priority is to reduce confusion in onboarding and starting quests. 
- Pilot plan: start with core features (habit/quest logging, points/badges, leaderboard, basic content), with safeguarding + privacy in place, and limited partnerships initially (do NOT build big “marketplace/token/API ecosystem” features for pilot unless already implemented and stable).

GOALS (in order)
1) Identify and fix all PILOT-BLOCKING issues (P0/P1): crashes, auth failures, quest-start failures, data-loss, broken navigation, blank screens, broken Supabase policies, broken deploy build.
2) Reduce friction in the two highest-risk funnels:
   A) Sign-up / onboarding
   B) Start quest / log action
3) Produce a “Pilot Readiness Report” with:
   - Bug list (severity, repro steps, expected vs actual, screenshots if possible)
   - Fixes made (PR/commit list)
   - Recommendations: what to ADD now vs later; what to REMOVE/disable for pilot
   - A short pilot test plan (10–15 scenarios) + acceptance criteria.

HARD RULES
- Optimize for pilot speed and stability. No huge refactors. Prefer targeted fixes.
- If something is unfinished/unstable, prefer feature flags or temporarily hiding it.
- Keep changes compatible with existing design system and navigation patterns in the repo.

PHASE 1 — SETUP & BASELINE
A) Inspect repo: identify stack, routing, state management, analytics/logging, Supabase client usage.
B) Get it running locally in Replit:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run dev server
   - Run typecheck/lint if available
   - Build (web/PWA) if supported
C) If you can access production:
   - Load play4earth.co
   - Open console/network and note errors
   - Record core flows status (signup → home, quest list → quest detail → start quest)

PHASE 2 — PILOT-CRITICAL FLOW TESTS (manual + quick automation)
Create a minimal test matrix (mobile widths + desktop PWA):
1) New user sign-up
2) Login/logout
3) Password reset (if exists)
4) Onboarding completion (name/avatar/preferences if exists)
5) Home loads with real data
6) Quest list loads (no empty crash)
7) Quest detail opens
8) Start quest (tap target area repeatedly to detect mis-taps)
9) Log an action / submit proof (if exists)
10) Points/badges update correctly
11) Leaderboard loads & updates (no infinite loading)
12) Rewards screen doesn’t break (even if rewards are “coming soon”)
13) Profile edit / view
14) Offline/poor connection behavior (at least graceful errors)
15) App refresh: session persists correctly

For each failure: capture repro steps + stack traces + network calls.

PHASE 3 — BUG HUNTING TARGETS (common pilot killers)
Investigate and fix issues in these areas:
A) Auth/session
   - Token refresh handling
   - Supabase auth state listeners
   - Redirect loops (web)
B) Navigation
   - Broken routes, wrong relative imports, duplicate routes, back button issues
C) Data layer
   - Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) blocking reads/writes
   - Missing indexes or slow queries causing timeouts
   - Null/undefined data not handled in UI
D) UI misclicks / confusion hotspots
   - Buttons with small hit areas
   - Non-obvious primary CTA (especially “Start quest”)
   - Multiple competing CTAs
   - No loading states / unclear success feedback
E) Error handling
   - Add user-friendly error banners/toasts for network/auth failures
   - Prevent blank screens

PHASE 4 — PILOT READINESS UPGRADES (small, high impact)
Implement only if lightweight:
1) In-app feedback button (opens email or simple form) + “Report a bug”
2) Simple “Pilot Mode” banner + short tutorial overlay for first run
3) Add analytics events (or verify existing):
   - signup_started / signup_completed
   - quest_viewed / quest_start_clicked / quest_started_success / quest_started_failed
   - action_logged_success / failed
   - misclick proxy: rapid repeated taps on CTA area
4) Add basic crash/error logging (Sentry or lightweight alternative) if none exists

PHASE 5 — WHAT TO ADD vs REMOVE FOR PILOT (deliver recommendation)
Make a clear recommendation list:

ADD NOW (pilot must-haves)
- Anything required to reduce onboarding + quest-start confusion
- Clear success feedback (toast/checkmark) after quest start and action log
- Basic admin “content switch” if quests need updating (even a JSON config)
- Safeguarding basics (age gate + reporting route if community features exist)
- Privacy/consent screen if collecting any personal/health/location data

REMOVE / DISABLE FOR PILOT (unless already stable)
- Token economy, marketplace, partner APIs, AR modules, complex verification, anything that adds surface area and risk
- Social feed/community chat if moderation/safeguarding is not production-ready
- Any half-built screens: replace with “Coming soon” static card

PHASE 6 — OUTPUT DELIVERABLES
1) “Pilot Readiness Report” (markdown) with:
   - Summary: Is it ready? What’s still blocking?
   - Bug table: severity (P0–P3), status, owner, fix link
   - UX friction fixes done (especially signup + quest start)
   - Add/Remove list
   - 10–15 step pilot test plan with acceptance criteria:
       * Zero P0/P1 bugs
       * Signup completion rate target improvement (reduce confusion)
       * Quest start success rate target improvement
       * No blank screens in core flows
2) Implement fixes directly in repo with clear commits and notes.
3) If something cannot be fixed quickly, document workaround + recommended temporary disable.

SEVERITY DEFINITIONS
- P0: App crash, cannot signup/login, cannot start quest, data loss, security/privacy critical issue.
- P1: Major flow broken for many users, severe UI confusion preventing progress, persistent blank loading.
- P2: Annoying but workaround exists, minor data mismatch, performance hiccups.
- P3: Cosmetic polish.

START NOW
Begin by running the app and testing signup → quest start. Report first findings fast, then fix P0/P1 issues first.
