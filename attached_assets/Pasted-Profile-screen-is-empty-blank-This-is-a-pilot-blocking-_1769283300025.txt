Profile screen is empty/blank. This is a pilot-blocking issue. Fix it so Profile always renders a useful UI, even with 0 activities and 0 points.

CONTEXT:
- Strava OAuth works and /api/strava/status returns connected athlete (per report).
- Sync can return 0 activities and 0 points if user has no recent Strava activity.
- Still, Profile must NOT be blank.

TASKS (in order):

1) Reproduce + diagnose:
- Open Profile in PILOT_MODE with a fresh user (0 activities).
- Check console/network.
- Identify which query returns empty (likely Supabase `profiles` fetch) or which conditional render causes blank.

2) Ensure `profiles` row exists for every authenticated user:
Choose ONE reliable approach (prefer #A):
A) Add a DB trigger in Supabase:
- On auth.users INSERT -> insert into public.profiles with id=NEW.id and defaults (display_name, points=0, created_at).
B) If trigger is not possible, add client-side upsert:
- On first login/signup, upsert into `profiles` with id=auth.uid() (requires RLS insert/update policies).
C) Server endpoint:
- /api/profile/ensure using service role, called after login (only if A/B not feasible).

3) Fix RLS policies for profiles (minimal, safe):
- Users can SELECT their own profile.
- Users can INSERT their own profile (if using upsert approach).
- Users can UPDATE their own profile fields.
- NO user can read other users’ private profile fields (leaderboard should use display_name only).

4) Make Profile UI resilient:
- Always render a header and sections with empty-states:
  - Name: show display_name or fallback “Player”
  - Points: show 0 if null
  - Strava: show “Not connected” + button OR “Connected” + athlete firstname/lastname + lastSync
  - Activity history: show “No verified activities yet. Connect Strava and tap Sync.”
  - Feedback: button visible
- Never early-return blank if data missing. Use loading skeleton + empty-state.

5) Connect Strava athlete data to profile:
- If user connects Strava and profile display_name is empty, set display_name from athlete firstname + last initial.
- Confirm /api/strava/status displays athlete and lastSync.

6) Verify with a real test:
- Create new user -> Profile loads (not blank)
- Connect Strava -> status shows Connected
- Sync Now:
   - If no activities, Profile still shows 0 but looks correct.
   - If activities exist, activity_events rows appear and points_ledger entries exist; Profile shows updated points.

DELIVERABLE:
- Short report: root cause + fix + DB changes (trigger/policies) + screenshots of Profile empty-state and connected state.
Do not proceed to publish until Profile is fixed.
