You are working on my existing Play for Planet Earth (PfPE) app codebase (Expo React Native + Expo Router, Supabase backend, deployed as a PWA). Goal: make the app investor-friendly AND usable as a real beta for a small community. Changes must be SMALL and shippable soon (no big refactors, no heavy dependencies).

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Keep the current UI/branding and match the existing Figma style (dark green theme + neon accent #D9FF3F).
- Keep route structure: main tabs in /app/(tabs); detail/modals outside (tabs).
- Shared UI stays in /components/ui and theme in /src/theme.
- Avoid heavy new dependencies.
- Must work even if offline or user is not logged in (graceful fallbacks).
- No complex “social network” build. Keep community features lightweight.

WHAT TO ADD (INVESTOR + BETA READY)

A) Dual Mode: Investor Demo Mode + Beta Community Mode
1) Investor Mode toggle (Profile)
- Toggle: “Investor Mode (Demo)”
- When ON:
  - Use seeded demo data for profile/quests/leaderboard/rewards (fake but realistic).
  - Show small “DEMO” badge in headers.
  - Disable/avoid protected backend calls to prevent auth issues in demos.
  - Store locally (AsyncStorage or existing local store pattern).

2) Beta Mode (default)
- Normal real app behavior.
- Add a “Beta” badge (small) in Profile only (not everywhere).

B) Invite-only Beta Access (small but powerful)
- Create a lightweight invite gate:
  - On first run (or before full access), show “Join the Beta” screen.
  - User can enter an invite code OR continue in “Explore mode” with limited features.
- Invite code validation:
  - EITHER: check code against a simple Supabase table (beta_invites) IF it exists.
  - OR fallback: accept a small set of hardcoded codes stored in app config (ENV) for now.
- When invite is accepted:
  - Save “beta_access=true” locally.
  - Unlock Leaderboard and ability to submit feedback.
- Explore mode (no code):
  - User can view Home + Quests but leaderboard is read-only or hidden.

C) Lightweight Community Loop (no big social build)
1) Community Leaderboard (small community friendly)
- Keep the current leaderboard UI but add:
  - “This Week” + “All Time” toggle (UI only; data can be derived).
  - “Your rank” pinned row.
- In Beta Mode:
  - Use real data if available; otherwise show “Not enough data yet” empty state + encourage inviting friends.
- In Investor Mode:
  - Show seeded leaderboard.

2) Team/Group (OPTIONAL, very light)
- Add “Join a Group” on Profile (optional):
  - Input: group code (e.g., “GOLDSMITHS”, “LONDON01”).
  - Save locally as group_id and filter leaderboard to that group if backend supports; if not, just display group name on Profile and in leaderboard header (“Group: LONDON01”).
- No group chat, no complex roles.

D) “Investor-friendly Proof” on Home (but also useful for users)
Add two new Home sections:
1) “Why PfPE works” card with 3 bullets:
- Daily quests → habit loop
- Community ranking → motivation
- Real rewards → real change

2) “Your week in numbers” card:
- Quests completed
- Estimated CO2 saved
- Active minutes
Use deterministic estimation constants (no external APIs):
- CO2 saved = quests_completed * 0.3 kg
- Active minutes = quests_completed * 6
If logged in and data exists, use real counts. Otherwise use local counters.

E) Feedback Loop (critical for beta + good for investors)
Add “Send Feedback” entry point on Profile and after completing a quest:
- New screen: /app/feedback.tsx (outside tabs)
- Simple form: category dropdown + text + optional screenshot upload (ONLY if already easy; otherwise skip screenshots).
- Save feedback:
  - Prefer Supabase table (beta_feedback) if it exists.
  - If not, store locally and show “Saved locally; will sync when online.”
- Add “Report a bug” quick option.
- Add “Feature request” option.

F) Micro-analytics (local only, investor-friendly, helps beta)
Instrument local event tracking (no big backend changes):
- track: app_open, signup_completed, quest_started, quest_completed, reward_viewed, share_clicked, feedback_submitted, invite_accepted
Store locally in a simple event log with timestamps.
Add a new screen: /app/insights.tsx (outside tabs) accessible from Profile:
- KPI cards (derived from local events):
  - Active days (last 7)
  - Quests completed (last 7)
  - Shares (last 7)
  - Feedback submitted
If Investor Mode: show “Sample cohort KPIs” using mock numbers clearly labeled as demo.

G) Share Impact (viral + community growth)
Add “Share your impact” button on Home and Profile:
- Route: /app/share-impact.tsx (outside tabs) or reuse existing share modal pattern.
- Generate share text:
  “This week I completed X quests and saved ~Y kg CO2 with Play for Planet Earth.”
- Increment share_clicked counter locally.

ONBOARDING POLISH (SMALL)
- Add a one-screen “Choose your focus” step:
  - Reduce waste / Eat greener / Move smarter / Learn climate
- Save selection and display on Profile (“Focus”).
- Improve empty states (quests/leaderboard/rewards) with clear calls to action.

ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS
- TypeScript, follow existing patterns.
- Use existing UI components from /components/ui.
- Keep routes outside /app/(tabs) so they don’t show in the tab bar.
- Don’t break existing auth; if not logged in, show graceful limited mode.
- No heavy new dependencies. Prefer built-in APIs and existing libraries.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- App runs without errors and looks consistent with current design.
- Investor Mode instantly makes the app feel “alive” with demo data.
- Beta Mode supports a small community via invite gating + feedback + share.
- Home shows proof/impact cards using real or local counters.
- Insights screen shows KPIs derived from local events.
- All changes are small, localized, and safe to ship quickly.

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
1) Scan repo + identify current screens/data flows.
2) Add Investor Mode + demo data provider (seeded).
3) Add Invite gate (Beta access) + Explore mode.
4) Add Feedback screen + local/supabase saving.
5) Add Home proof cards + Share impact.
6) Add Insights screen from local event log.
7) Polish empty states and onboarding focus step.

Return:
- Summary of changes
- List of modified/added files
- Any small next-step ideas that remain lightweight
